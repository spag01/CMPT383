The following assignments and course project is my personal work. Please DO NOT COPY the work. 

The course project was about to code for the same program in three different programming languages including Racket and Haskell. The third language  (mainstream language) was my choice. So I did my code in C++.

Below is the report for the project:

Implementation Section 
1. Performance
1. C++ implementation = about 0.70 seconds in linux
2. Racket implementation = takes about 0.85 seconds in Dr.racket
3. Haskell implementation = 0.80s user 0.17s system 1% cpu 53.134 total on mac terminal.
Overall, I find C++ implementation quicker.

2. Ease of development
For mainstream language, I used C++ and it took me around one complete day to get the code done. After completing the work, I spent like 2 hours on debugging the code. I was getting one file outputs wrong especially in “empty” case output.
For racket implementation, the early implementation code took 4 days to get perfectly done. But I forgot to test for some files. The code was working for example10.txt file. I had to change some code and make the code read every user input file in my final project. This took me 5 hours to get it done. Finally, I made the code working properly after giving 2 days during final project implementation.
For Haskell implementation, the implementation took about 4 days to get completed. But it took a lot of time to debug the code. The code wasn’t reading the files properly. I had to learn all about “stack” and “ghci”. I run the code in mac terminal. I got to do figure out how to run main function in the terminal of the mac. S, this whole thing took 2 days.
Overall, I really enjoyed doing the same program in three different languages tried to relate the things between them. The program made me to learn more commands than I used to know. I even did code in VS code and try running my program there. Learning and using stack and ghci was good as well. Lastly, Dr. racket is also easy software to use. So, these little things developed my interest in the program as well.

3. Quality of source code

Number of lines
4. C++ implementation = 78 lines
5. Racket implementation = 69 lines
6. Haskell implementation = 65 lines

Number of named functions
1. C++ implementation = 3 functions including main which has the function calls and general C++ functions.
2. Racket implementation = 11 functions
3. Haskell implementation = 4 functions including main

4. How to run
1. For C++
• The code can be run in C++ (Ubuntu/Linux)
• Use the following commands in the terminal- g++ final_project.cpp
./a.out

2. For racket
Press cntrl/command R in DR. racket

3. For Haskell
locate the final+project.hs file in the system.
Load the main function using command – ghci final_project.hs then write “main” everytime you run the code.
Then enter the name of the ballot file.

Conclusion
I am more comfortable in doing C++ program. I got it done in less time. So, this would be the go-to language for me in the future. Moreover, I liked doing code in the other two languages, Racket, and Haskell. These were knowledgeable and fun to learn.
